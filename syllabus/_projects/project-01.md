title: Valid, Responsive-Ready HTML
due_date: &deadline 2020-09-24
preview: false
goals:
  - Produce modern standards-compliant HTML pages
  - Write valid, well-formed semantic HTML
  - Effectively comment on, format, and lint source code for maximum readability
  - Track the development of a project over time using version control
requirements:
  - >
    All source files in UTF-8/Unicode character encoding with Unix-style line endings (LF), entabbed
    with spaces (two spaces per tab)
  - >
    Well-formed, valid semantic HTML5. Projects whose HTML does not validate with the [W3C HTML
    validator](https://validator.w3.org/) will receive a zero-point, failing grade. In the unlikely
    event that you discover a validation error or warning that is a genuine bug in the validator,
    you must acknowledge that bug in the email that accompanies your final project, and point to the
    relevant documentation, such as specifications or an existing reputable bug report, that your
    source is in fact correct. Get in the habit of validating and linting your HTML before you
    commit to Git.
  - >
    Only structural, semantic uses of HTML elements and attributes. **Absolutely no** table markup,
    break tags, or any other use of HTML to achieve a particular page layout. (All layout and design
    will be handled via CSS in the next project. For this project, I urge you not to spend any time
    at all looking at your pages in a browser. Stick close to your source code and the HTML
    validator.) **Be sure to use the `htmllint` linter.**
  - >
    A semantically structured navigation area for accessing each of your project’s pages from any
    other page
  - >
    Organized, readable source that is hand-written and original (no WYSIWYGs or code-generators, no
    Bootstrap or other off-the-shelf frameworks)
  - >
    Directory-based URLs with use of the default-served index.html file, so that you can point to,
    for example, `example.com/resume/`
  - >
    A Git repository with frequent commits and meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect
    each set of changes that you make
  - >
    **Do not** attempt any visual design in this project; choose your HTML tags for semantics. The
    *next project will add in CSS, which will handle all visual design features
  - Your Git repository must contain **only** the files and commits from this project

      Post draft project-repository GitHub link to the

For this project, you will create at least three well-formed, valid semantic HTML pages that will
form the foundation of your professional web presence. One of the pages must be your professional
resume.
