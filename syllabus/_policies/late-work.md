title: Late Work
---

All work must be submitted before the date and time specified in each project description. Weekly
work is due by the start of the first class meeting each week. <strong>The deadlines in this class,
including for draft work, are no different from exam dates in classes that have exams.</strong> I
expect you to do your best to treat them accordingly. If you believe you are in danger of missing a
deadline, be sure to contact me well ahead of time so we can work something out.
