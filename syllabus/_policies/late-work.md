title: Late Work
---

All work must be submitted before the date and time specified in each project description. Weekly
work, including reading discussions, is due by the start of the first class meeting each week.
<strong>The deadlines in this class, including for draft work, are no different from exam dates in
classes that have exams.</strong> I expect you to do your best to treat them accordingly. If you
believe you are in danger of missing a deadline, be sure to contact me well ahead of time so we can
work something out.
