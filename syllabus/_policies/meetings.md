<h3>In-Person Meetings</h3>
If you are able to attend our class meetings on the Mies Campus, here are some important but
simple guidelines:

* **In keeping with [the University’s masking policy](https://www.iit.edu/reopening), everyone in
  the classroom, including all students and the instructor, must wear a mask, regardless of
  vaccination status.** Changes to University policy will be reflected here.
* **If you are sick or even just think you’re sick, stay home.** You can watch class live via Google
  Meet or later on YouTube. There is no penalty for missing an in-person class, and definitely no
  reward for trying to be heroic and showing up if you’re unwell. Your health—and the health of
  those around you—is the top priority. But do check in with me so that you stay on track as you are
  able.

<h3>Online Meetings</h3>
If you are able to attend our class meetings via Google Meet, or if our class has any online-only
meetings, here are just a few simple guidelines:

* **You do not have to broadcast your camera.** For any reason. The choice is yours. It’s helpful
  for me to be able to glance at faces and see how everyone is reacting, but it’s totally up to you
  whether to broadcast your camera or not.
* **Please mute your mic if you’re not speaking.** Self-explanatory. Muted mics cut down on ambient
  noise and occasional echo that can be real problems for people who have hearing difficulties. I
  encourage you to turn on the live closed captioning when we’re in Google Meet.
* **Neither you nor our Meet room will appear in class videos.** I will always teach class with our
  Google Meet room on a second screen that will not be recorded. If you opt to speak, your voice
  may be in the video, of course. But you also have the option of messaging in the Meet room by
  text; I will keep an eye on that as class is going, in case you wish to raise questions or ask for
  clarification that way.
* **If my Internet connection fails, I will still record and post class.** That kind of thing does
  happen: sometimes before class, sometimes during. If I’ve got Internet troubles, I’ll post to
  Basecamp from my phone and let everyone know what’s going on.
* **All class meetings will be posted to YouTube.** You’ll be able to watch class on your own time
  if you’re unable to attend the live class. I invite students to contribute markers to index the
  videos on YouTube, too, to help anyone who needs to go back and find and rewatch something. Again,
  I will take great care not to accidentally record our chat room. I will share a playlist link for
  all of our videos on Basecamp and on the course website.
