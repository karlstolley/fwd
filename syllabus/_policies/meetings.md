title: Class Meeting Expectations and Etiquette
---

If you are able to attend our class meetings on Google Meet, here are just a few simple guidelines:

* **You do not have to broadcast your camera.** For any reason. The choice is yours. It’s helpful
  for me to be able to glance at faces and see how everyone is reacting, but it’s totally up to you
  whether to broadcast your camera or not.
* **Please mute your mic if you’re not speaking.** Self-explanatory. Muted mics cut down on ambient
  noise and occasional echo that can be real problems for people who have hearing difficulties. I
  encourage you to turn on the live closed captioning when we’re in Google Meet.
* **Neither you nor our Meet room will appear in videos.** I will always teach class with our Google
  Meet room on a second screen that will not be recorded. If you opt to speak, your voice will be
  in the video, of course. But you also have the option of messaging in the Meet room by text; I
  will keep an eye on that as class is going, in case you wish to raise questions or ask for
  clarification that way.
* **All class meetings will be posted to YouTube.** You’ll be able to watch class on your own time
  if you’re unable to attend the live class. I have some pretty cool tricks for helping to index the
  videos on YouTube, too, if you need to go back and find and rewatch something. Again, I will take
  great care not to accidentally record our chat room. I will share a playlist link for all of our
  videos on Basecamp and on the course website.
* **If my Internet connection fails, I will still record and post class.** That kind of thing does
  happen: sometimes before class, sometimes during. If I’ve got Internet troubles, I’ll post to
  Basecamp from my phone and let everyone know what’s going on.
