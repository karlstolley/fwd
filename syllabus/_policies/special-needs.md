title: Special Needs

I make it my very top priority to create courses that are welcoming and accessible to all students.
I will make additional reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities. In order
to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for
Disability Resources. [The Center for Disability Resources](https://web.iit.edu/cdr) is located in
IIT Tower, 3424 S. State Street - 3F3-1 (third floor, in the northwest corner across from the
Student Health and Wellness Center). Contact the Center by telephone at 312-567-5744, by TDD at
312-567-5135, or via email at [disabilities@iit.edu](mailto:disabilities@iit.edu)

Students who have any difficulty, either permanent or temporary, that might affect their ability to
successfully participate in and complete the class should contact me privately, either in person or
electronically, at the start of the semester or as a difficulty arises. That includes difficulties
with housing, internet access, and anything that otherwise compromises your sense of safety,
security, and support—especially if it impacts your ability to complete this class. Please reach
out.

I will adjust methods, materials, or deadlines as necessary to ensure equitable participation for
all students.

<h3>Mental Health and Well-Being</h3>

It’s no secret that attending school while managing and balancing other life concerns is incredibly
stressful and at times completely overwhelming. And that’s when there’s not a global pandemic
raging, disrupting all aspects of our lives. All of us, no matter how outwardly strong, successful,
or put-together we might appear, struggle sometimes.

Illinois Tech provides all students with a variety of free counseling services. I encourage all
students to seek support and help from the
[Counseling Services](https://web.iit.edu/shwc/services/counseling-services) unit of the Student
Health and Wellness Center. Students facing a crisis situation, especially outside of the Counseling
Services unit’s operating hours, may wish to call the
[National Suicide Prevention Lifeline](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/) at 1-800-273-8255.
The Student Health and Wellness Center maintains

<h3>Illinois Tech’s Policy on Sexual Harassment and Discrimination</h3>

Illinois Tech prohibits all sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and gender discrimination by any
member of our community. This includes harassment among students, staff, or faculty. Sexual
harassment of a student by a faculty member or sexual harassment of an employee by a supervisor is
particularly serious. Such conduct may easily create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive
environment.

Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or sexual misconduct to speak with
the Office of Title IX Compliance for information on support options and the resolution process.

You can report sexual harassment electronically at [iit.edu/incidentreport](iit.edu/incidentreport),
which may be completed anonymously. You may additionally report by contacting the Title IX
Coordinator, Virginia Foster at [foster@iit.edu](mailto:foster@iit.edu), or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator, Esther Espeland
at [eespeland@iit.edu](mailto:eespeland@iit.edu).

For confidential support, you may reach Illinois Tech’s Confidential Advisor at 773-907-1062. You
can also contact a licensed practitioner in Illinois Tech’s Student Health and Wellness Center at
[student.health@iit.edu](mailto:student.health@iit.edu) or 312-567-7550

For a comprehensive list of resources regarding counseling services, medical assistance, legal
assistance and visa and immigration services, you can visit the Office of Title IX Compliance
