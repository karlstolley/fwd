      Office hours via Basecamp Chat or Pings on Tuesdays, 4pm to 5pm Central Time
      (America/Chicago), or by appointment or chance. If you’d like to audio or video chat, we can
      of course do that, too. Just message me first. I’m always signed into Basecamp and closely
      monitor my notifications. Message or email any time—I make students a priority, and I will
      respond as soon as I am able.
