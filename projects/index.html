            Valid, well-formed semantic HTML5. Projects whose HTML does not validate with the
            <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML validator</a> will receive a zero-point,
            failing grade. In the unlikely event that you discover a validation error or warning
            that is a genuine bug in the validator, you must acknowledge that bug in the memo that
            accompanies your project, and point to the relevant documentation, such as
            specifications or an existing reputable bug report, that your source is in fact correct.
            Get in the habit early of validating your HTML before you commit to Git.
          </li>
          <li>
            Only structural, semantic uses of HTML elements and attributes. <b>Absolutely no</b>
            table markup, break tags, or any other use of HTML to achieve a particular page layout.
            (All layout and design will be handled via CSS in the next project. For this project, I
            urge you not to spend much time at all looking at your pages in a browser. Stick close
            to your source code and the HTML validator.)

          This project builds on Project One, which you will fully style with CSS to provide a basic
          typographic treatment and responsive design that makes judicious use of media queries and
          relative units (<code>em</code>/<code>rem</code>, <code>vw</code>, <code>%</code>). You
          will deploy your pages to a server pointed at by your personal domain name, or a subdomain
